# RecycleXR

RecycleXR is an interactive XR application created to educate users about recycling by focusing on picking up and sorting recyclables into the correct bin. Users will pick up a virtual recyclable object, read its label to understand what it is made of, and then place it in the correct bin. The focus will be on making the interaction of picking up and sorting items smooth and intuitive. This will take place in a single scene, with the user's environment as the backdrop.
This project addresses SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by teaching users how to properly recycle and raising awareness about the environmental impact of waste.
This is a standalone project, aiming to create an engaging recycling experience using Godot XR technologies.

### Key Features
- **Core Interaction**: Users will focus on picking up and releasing recyclables using hand tracking.
- **Simple Recycling Task**: The project will focus on sorting recyclables such as plastic, paper, and glass.
- **Educational Content**: When an item is sorted correctly, users will hear an audio cue or see a message explaining why it's important to recycle that material.
- **Polished Experience**: The interaction of grabbing and sorting recyclables will feel fluid and natural with smooth animations, simple lighting, and clear labels.

### XR Tech
- **Hand Tracking**: Users will pick up objects and place them in the bins using natural hand gestures.
- **Passthrough**: Virtual bins and items will be overlaid in the real-world environment
